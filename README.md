"Would you rather...?" is a browser game that presents the player with a series of questions beginning with "Would you rather...?". For each question, two options are provided as answers. The player can select only one of them.

Players can create new questions and visit a leaderboard to see which players have answered the most questions.

To be able to play, users need to login first.

If they try to access a poll that doesn't exist, a 404 page is displayed.

If they try to create a question that already exists, a friendly error message and a button to answer the question are displayed.

The game is built using <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Redux</strong>, and <strong>React Router</strong>. It was the final project in the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
